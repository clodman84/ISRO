## How to install
![GUI](https://github.com/clodman84/ISRO/blob/main/demos/gui.png)

Extract and run Timelapse.exe from the [releases](https://github.com/clodman84/ISRO/releases) if you do not have python and/or ffmpeg installed.

To run from code:
* Python 3.10
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Make sure that ffmpeg is installed
* Run main.py

## How it works

Downloads images from the [Mosdac Gallery](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/gallery/index.html) and uses ffmpeg to create the video.
